# Image-and-Sentence-Matching-via-Semantic-Concepts-and-Order-Learning
Created an advanced image and sentence matching system using CNN for semantic extraction, context-modulated attention LSTM for ordering, and efficient sentence generation with LSTM. Implemented on Google Colab, Flask, Ngrok, PyTorch, TensorFlow, using datasets including Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO.
